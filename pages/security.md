It's very tempting not to worry about securing yourself online. We've all felt fairly safe, with not too much at risk.  It's more important to some of us to make sure our door is locked at night.  But much of our lives is increasingly exposed and here's what I advise all of my friends and family.  

One quick note first.  Please don't let any of this scare you. I don't mean to make you think that the internet is a big, scray place that you should avoid, but instead just want to offer common sense advice now that we all are empowered by and use it.  Some of this will feel techinical at first, but please hang in there - you really will get used to all of this, and with familiarity will come fluency.  

## Advice (summary)

4. Set up 2-factor authentication (2FA) for as many services as you can.  2FA for your email, password safe, and financial sites (and your 2FA service) are critical.  
2. Use long, distinct passwords for your email and password safe. 
3. Get a password safe and use it. 
3. Don't re-use passwords for _anything_ important.  
5. Go ahead and set up 2FA everywhere you can.  
6. Encrypt your devices.
7. Don't plug into strange USB stations. 
8. Install updates.

## Why should you care? (summary) 

There are a few realms of risk that we all have, generally in this order of severity:  

1. Money that can be taken away from you
2. Financial damange that can be done to you
3. Data of yours that can be:
  4. Destroyed 
  5. Held hostage 
  6. Publicly exposed 
  7. Used to blackmail you

## Advice (expanded)

### Set up 2-factor authentication.  

Please hear this - a username and password by themselves are no longer enough.  One way or another, they will fail you - maybe tomorrow, maybe in 6 months, maybe not until next year, but someday it will happen and when it does, if you don't have a 2nd layer of security, one or more of those risks above will happen to you.   The **single** best thing you can do right now, is to set up 2 factor authentication (2FA) right now.  

This feels like an extra step for the highly technical or those who are protecting super-sensitive secrets.  Maybe it once was but not anymore.  The future has arrived and having and using 2FA is part of what it means to be safe in this day and age.  Setting up 2FA is now as fundamental as locking your windows on your home.
