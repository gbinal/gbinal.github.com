title: "What I tell my family about security online"
---

It's very tempting not to worry about securing yourself online. We've all felt fairly safe, with not too much at risk.  It's more important to some of us to make sure our door is locked at night.  But much of our lives is increasingly exposed and here's what I advise all of my friends and family.  

One quick note first.  Please don't let any of this scare you. I don't mean to make you think that the internet is a big, scray place that you should avoid, but instead just want to offer common sense advice now that we all are empowered by and use it.  Some of this will feel techinical at first, but please hang in there - you really will get used to all of this, and with familiarity will come fluency.  

## Advice (summary)

4. Set up 2-factor authentication (2FA) for as many services as you can.  2FA for your email, password safe, and financial sites (and your 2FA service) are critical.  
2. Use long, distinct passwords for your email and password safe. 
3. Get a password safe and use it. 
3. Don't re-use passwords for _anything_ important.  
5. Go ahead and set up 2FA everywhere you can.

## Why should you care? (summary) 

There are a few realms of risk that we all have, generally in this order of severity:  

1. Money that can be taken away from you
2. Financial damange that can be done to you
3. Data of yours that can be:
  4. Destroyed 
  5. Held hostage 
  6. Publicly exposed 
  7. Used to blackmail you

## Advice (expanded)

### Set up 2-factor authentication.  

Please hear this - a username and password by themselves are of limited value.  For a lot of reasons, they may fail you, maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, but sometime. Having a 2nd layer to your security makes it much, much safer at that point.

This feels like an extra step for the highly technical or those who are protecting super-sensitive secrets.  Maybe it once was but not anymore.  The future has arrived and having and using 2FA is part of what it means to be safe in this day and age.  If you lock your windows on your home, use 2FA.

## Why should you care? (expanded) 


1. Money that can be taken away from you

This area is the one we think of most.  You have money in your bank accounts and you don't want someone to take it. You have credit cards and you don't want to buy a bunch of things with it and stick you with the bill.  

But we often forget a few side doors that expose us.  


Threat vectors:  

Bank Account 
Credit Cards 
Paypal/Venmo/Etc. 
Stores

### Your Data That Is Online

* Think through all of the websites you use and about what you have stored in them.  
  * Your email
  * Photos 
  * Music and playlists 
  * Documents 
  * Anything you've stored in Dropbox, Google Drive
  * Your purchase history.  
  * 
  * 


Remember, it's not just you that you are protecting.  We are intertwined with our friends, coworkers, and loved ones.  These common sense steps are worthwhile for the value they offer you, but if you don't do them for yourself, do them for the people in your life.  Because they are vulnerable through your vulnerabilities.  If you don't protect your email account and someone posts every email you have online, it's not just you who might be embarrassed or hurt.  It's also all of those people in your inbox.  

Think through each of the above and any other data that you have somewhere out there.  
* First - For any of that, think about how bad it will be, how much you will care if someone was able to go in and delete it.  To take it away from you and you could
