### 'What If' Series

Just a few of my favorites:  
* [What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/)  
* [What would it be like to navigate a rowboat through a lake of mercury? What about bromine? Liquid gallium? Liquid tungsten? Liquid nitrogen? Liquid helium?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/50/)  
* [What if I took a swim in a typical spent nuclear fuel pool? Would I need to dive to actually experience a fatal amount of radiation? How long could I stay safely at the surface?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/29/)  
* [Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/21/)  
* [In Armageddon, a NASA guy comments that a plan to shoot a laser at the asteroid is like “shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train.” What would it take to stop an out-of-control freight train using only b.b. guns?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/18/)  
* [What would happen if everyone on earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/8/)
