## Accept the results of the election and move on from re-litigating it to engaging with the results. 

It will be tempting to stay focused on the 2016 election and to fight over it.  It's human to want to stay on a root source of our current issues, especially when others may disagree with twhy and how it happened.  

But doing this is not an effective way to engage on the issues and events that come up during the Trump administration.  It's 'fighting the last war' when we are all needed in the what's going on here and now.   

## Affirm to yourself and create a reminder: "This is not normal."

## Sign up for (and support) legitimate news.  

  * Things to sign up for. 
    * New York Times
    * Washington Post
    * Propublica
  * Things to support.  
## Support (and sign up for) progressive causes.  

## Support (and sign up for) core organizations that support American democracy.  



## Find a small way to be out and proud.  

Whether it's wearing a safety pin on your shirt, putting a bumper sticker on your car, or adding a button to your backpack or purse

## Speak up in everyday moments.  

This is probably the most difficult of these and you won't always be up for it.  But there will be tiny, everyday moments when someone around you casually affirms the some of the disturbing trends of the Trump presidency.  When you can, try to politely but sincerely speak up at some point to disagreemenet or concern.  

You don't need to try to change the other person's mind (it's often not possible to do that in one moment), but it's critical in these times to try and speak up in support of what we believe in and to show that good people can disagree on the direction the country may be going.  

## Meet up.  

Find local events where citizens are coming together to discuss current events, plan for ways to organize and push back, and support each other.  You'll find strength and reinforcement in these groups and your showing up give energy to everyone else coming to those.  

* Search for progressive or interest groups that you are passionate about in your area [on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/).  
* Look up your local Democratic Party and find out when they meet.  

## Get active.  

* Look up the phone numbers for your US Senators and Congress members and, whenever ssomething seems particularly wrong headed - call them and tell them so.  You'll either speak with a low level staffer or get their voicemail, but *they make a note of how many people call, on what issues, and what side they are on, so this matters.*.  
* Write a brief letter to the editor of your local paper.  They print those and people read them.  

## Allow yourself to still laugh and be happy...
