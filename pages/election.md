This presidential election is incredibly important.  It is not enough that Hillary Clinton win. We need her to win *big*. 

Let us do as much as we can today, tonight, tomorrow, and every day through election day.  Here are ways to step up.  

* *Vote Early* - Can you [vote early in your state](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/early-voting-states-228435)?  If so, DO!  It frees up the campaign to focus on turning out other voters; frees you up to volunteer on election day; and helps lessen lines at the polls (you may have plenty of time on election day, but remember that there are single parents and people with long work hours who'll have to drop out of line before getting a chance to vote!)
* *Show Your Support* - Buy or make a t-shirt, button, or bag.  Wherever you are in America, it's important to be loud and proud in support of Hillary Clinton for the next three weeks.  
* *Update Your Social Media* - Change your Facebook/Twitter/etc. profile picture to show your support.  It's a small thing but makes an impression.  
* *Find Events Near You* - There are [all kinds of events happening near you](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/events/) - today, this weekend, all of the time.  There are all kinds of events - find something that can work for you and sign up!  This is how we win.  
* *Find A Nearby Office and Go Visit* - There are hundreds of campaign offices around the country. [Find the closest one to you](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tools/find-your-field-office/) and go say hi!  Stop in to say hello and give them some moral support.  Sign up to volunteer if you can, but also find out when they have events coming up so you can 


* *Encourage friends and family* -
