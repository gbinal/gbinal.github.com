This presidential election is incredibly important.  It is not enough that Hillary Clinton win. We need her to win *big*. 

Let us do as much as we can today, tonight, tomorrow, and every day through election day.  Here are ways to step up.  

### Now 

* *Vote Early* - Can you [vote early in your state](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/early-voting-states-228435)?  If so, DO!  It frees up the campaign to focus on turning out other voters; frees you up to volunteer on election day; and helps lessen lines at the polls (you may have plenty of time on election day, but remember that there are single parents and people with long work hours who'll have to drop out of line before getting a chance to vote!)
* *Show Your Support Around Town* - Buy or make a t-shirt, button, or bag.  Wherever you are in America, it's important to be loud and proud in support of Hillary Clinton for the next three weeks.  
* *Update Your Social Media* - Change your Facebook/Twitter/etc. profile picture to show your support.  It's a small thing but makes an impression.  
* *Find Events Near You* - There are [all kinds of events happening near you](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/events/) - today, this weekend, all of the time.  There are all kinds of events - find something that can work for you and sign up!  This is how we win.  
* *Find A Nearby Office and Go Visit* - There are hundreds of campaign offices around the country. [Find the closest one to you](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tools/find-your-field-office/) and go say hi!  Stop in to say hello and give them some moral support.  Find out about upcoming events and sign up to volunteer.
* *Write a Letter to the Editor* - I know it seems old fashioned but take the time to write a short, sincere note to your local paper expressing how unusual and important this election is and your support for Hillary Clinton.
* *Ask Yourself Who You Know in a Swing State* - Check out the list of `States to Watch` [here](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo) and ask yourself who you know in those states.  For whoever you're game to, reach out to them and tell them how important this election is and encourage them to vote.  
* *Encourage friends and family* - Talk with friends and family about how important you feel this election is and, as you see fit, encourage them to get involved, too.  If helpful, send them this link for ways to get involved.  
* *Be Positive and Affirming on Social Media* - Speak up on social media with positive messages of support for Hillary Clinton, as well as non-political condemnations of Donald Trump.  


### On Election Day

* *Get Excited* - Enthusiasm spreads.  First thing on election day, go online and post your support and enthusiasm.  Cheer others on as the day goes along.  Your energy will ripple and add to others around you.  
* *Volunteer!!!* - This is the big day!  There are a number of ways to help on election day - putting out door hangers, waving signs at intersections, giving rides to the polling station, or volunteering as a poll watcher.
