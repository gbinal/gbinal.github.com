So - On Monday August 21, 2017 - there's going to be a really cool event - a total solar eclipse.  Here are some notes:  


## TL;DR 
* If you can at all do it, plan for and travel to see the totality of the solar eclipse instead of being content to see a partial eclipse.  
* Read more below and plan ahead - don't plan to wing it the day of.  
* If you can't travel to see the totality of a solar eclipse, you'll likely still see a partial eclipse almost anywhere in the country, which'll be really cool and is also worth planning for.  Read more below.

## Assorted Notes 

* Remember that for roughly an hour before and after the total eclipse, there will be a partial eclipse occuring that'll be really cool to see.  You can use [this tool](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/25/16019892/solar-eclipse-2017-interactive-map), [this map], or [this map] to find out what the start and finish times will be.  
* Consider taking children out of school to experience this.  Many schools will understandably choose to keep them indoors intentionally in order to avoid any liabiity on their part and given how rare and wonderful of an event this is, if you can [help](https://live.washingtonpost.com/qa-eclipse-coverage-live-20170801.html#4799181) them to experience it safely, do!  
* In general, don't bother too much trying to take pictures of the sun - it's hard to do well, distracts you from enjoying the moment, and there'll be tons of other professional photography taken that you can point to afterwards anyways.  If you want to try though, [here's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/08/01/want-to-use-your-phone-to-photograph-the-solar-eclipse-read-this-first) some articles.  
* The total eclipse will begin in Oregon at about 10:15AM PT/1:15PM ET.  The 70-mile wide total shadow will then travel at ~2,000 miles per hour (~32 miles per minute) across the country before exiting South Carolina at about 11:50AM PT/2:50PM ET.  Areas right in the middle of the totality will get about 2 1/2 minutes of straight up nighttime.  The national event will last about an hour and a half and there'll be plenty of live streams and tv coverage of it if you're stuck indoors or suffer the cruel fate of cloud cover.

At any stage other than when the sun is completely, 100% blocked by the moon, you need eclipse glasses.  As soon as the sun starts to reappear, you gotta switch back to
