So - On Monday August 21, 2017 - there's going to be a really cool event - a total solar eclipse.  Here are some notes:  


## TL;DR 
* If you can at all do it, plan for and travel to see the totality of the solar eclipse instead of being content to see a partial eclipse.  
* Read more below and plan ahead - don't plan to wing it the day of.  
* If you can't travel to see the totality of a solar eclipse, you'll likely still see a partial eclipse almost anywhere in the country, which'll be really cool and is also worth planning for.  Read more below.

## Assorted Notes 

* Remember that for roughly an hour before and after the total eclipse, there will be a partial eclipse occuring that'll be really cool to see.  You can use [this tool](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/25/16019892/solar-eclipse-2017-interactive-map), [this map], or [this map] to find out what the start and finish times will be.  
* Consider taking children out of school to experience this.  Many schools will understandably choose to keep them indoors intentionally in order to avoid any liabiity on their part and given how rare and wonderful of an event this is, if you can help them to experience it safely, do!
