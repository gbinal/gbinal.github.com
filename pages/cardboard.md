title: "Google Cardboard Notes"
---

So, I basically recommend that everyone in my life buy a $12-15 Google Cardboard.  Today.  It's an utterly inexpensive, really great way to start experiencing good virtual reality.  Below are some recommendations that I'm putting together.  I'll keep adding to them, but they should be enough to get you started for now.  

### Overview

Here's a [super short explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4bUHZB4__w) of what Cardboard is.  If you want a longer one, there's a [ton of videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+cardboard) on YouTube that'll help explain.   But really, skip those, just buy one, and load up some apps and experience it yourself.  You won't regret it.  

### Will it work on any smartphone?  

Yes.  Cardboard now works on both Android and Apple phones.  It _might_ not work well on much older smartphones though (3-4+ years old.).  


### Which one should I get?  

Like Android phones, there's dozens of choices - most are solid but plenty are cheap knock offs.  Here's my buying advice:
* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Search on Amazon for '[google cardboard v2](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=google+cardboard+v2)'.  
* Filter the results for those that have [4 or more stars](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agoogle+cardboard+v2%2Cp_72%3A2661618011&keywords=google+cardboard+v2&ie=UTF8&qid=1452147319&rnid=2661617011) and pick one that has plenty of reviews.  
* I'm still trying out others but have used [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018G1CJ3U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00) [two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TEDLGFC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s02) and thought both were solid.  
* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Don't worry about headstraps at this stage.  You're just going to hold it up.  
* Google made several important [changes](https://hoonite.com/blog/devices/the-new-generation-of-google-cardboard-v2-has-arrived/) when they rolled out v2 of the Cardboard standard, so you're better off with that.  v1 Cardboards still work fine.  


### Okay, I've got one.  Now what apps should I try?  

#### For Android phones





Android has a big head start so their app offerings are more extensive, but there's plenty to see using an iPhone, too.
