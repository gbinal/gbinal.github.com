So, I basically recommend that everyone in my life buy a $12-15 Google Cardboard.  Today.  It's an utterly inexpensive, really great way to start experiencing good virtual reality.  Below are some recommendations that I'm putting together.  I'll keep adding to them, but they should be enough to get you started for now.  

### Overview

Here's a [super short explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4bUHZB4__w) of what Cardboard is.  If you want a longer one, there's a [ton of videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+cardboard) on YouTube that'll help explain.   But really, skip those, just buy one, and load up some apps and experience it yourself.  You won't regret it.  

### Will it work on any smartphone?  

Yes.  Cardboard now works on both Android and Apple phones.  It _might_ not work well on much older smartphones though (3-4+ years old.).  


### Which one should I get?  

_When You're Starting Out..._

Like Android phones, there's dozens of choices - most are solid but plenty are cheap knock offs.  Here's my buying advice:  

* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Search on Amazon for '[google cardboard v2](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=google+cardboard+v2)'.  
* Filter the results for those that have [4 or more stars](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agoogle+cardboard+v2%2Cp_72%3A2661618011&keywords=google+cardboard+v2&ie=UTF8&qid=1452147319&rnid=2661617011) and pick one that has plenty of reviews.  
* I'm still trying out others but have used [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018G1CJ3U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00) [two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TEDLGFC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s02) and thought both were solid.  
* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Don't worry about headstraps at this stage.  You're just going to hold it up.  
* Google made several important [changes](https://hoonite.com/blog/devices/the-new-generation-of-google-cardboard-v2-has-arrived/) when they rolled out v2 of the Cardboard standard, so you're better off with that.  v1 Cardboards still work fine.  

_But Then..._

I've now tried out 7 different cardboards and 3 have stuck out to me, so I've given the rest away as gifts and use these:   

* [Mattel View-master](https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-DTH61-View-Master-Deluxe-Viewer/dp/B01CNSO79Q/ref=sr_1_7?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1500342174&sr=1-7&keywords=viewmaster) ($24) - This remake of the classic view-master tries to modernize the same experience with digital slides and that experience is rubbish.  Ironically, though, it dual functions as a Cardboard Viewer and [is actually one of the best](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2995583/android/the-best-cheap-cardboard-vr-viewer-is-mattels-view-master.html) [views out there](http://toyland.gizmodo.com/the-virtual-reality-view-master-2-0-will-be-the-best-go-1758981678).  Very comfortable, a great clicker, and just more solid than most cardboards.  
* [Unofficial Cardboard v2](http://www.unofficialcardboard.com/products/2-0-plus?variant=16856200839) ($21+shipping) - This is my favorite cardboard viewer that is actually cardboard.  It's well-made, the adjustable lens are really useful for some folks, and it's worth paying extra to get the headstrap since this is the only time I've tried a headstrap that actually works well and sometimes there's a place for one.  
* [Goggle Tech](http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Goggle-Tech-C1-Glass-Smartphones/dp/B01884YMKI?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01) ($25) - These work well and get the job done, though the experience isn't quite as good as the above two.  That said, they fold down into a really small container that easily fits in your pocket or a bag.  I actually keep this one in my backback to have a cardboard viewer handy and often forget that it's there.  

### Okay, I've got one.  Now what apps should I try?  

There's a ton to try but here's some highlights to get you started. Remember, it's that any app is the best thing since sliced bread, but rather the innovation and newness of the experience.  

#### For Android phones

* Start with the [official Cardboard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo).
* The [NYT VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.im360nytvr), [Vrse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shakingearthdigital.vrsecardboard), and [Jaunt VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.android.player.cardboard&hl=en) apps are all must-haves.  They are full of higher-quality videos.  
* Jaunt is making a ton of [good content](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jaunt+Inc) that is [worth experiencing](http://www.jauntvr.com/content/).  
* The YouTube and [Street View](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street) apps have a lot of amazing cardboard experiences.  
  * For YouTube, open the app, search for '360' and you'll find an account called '#360Video'.  Another path is to go to [youtube.com/360](https://www.youtube.com/360)  All of those are cardboard-ready.  Once you press play, you'll see a cardboard icon that you'll press.  
  * For Street View, the best way to interact with it by going in through the official Cardboard app first.  
* [Titans of Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drashvr.titansofspacecb) is beautiful.  
* My favorite games so far are [Caaaaardboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dejobaangames.caaaaardboard&hl=en) (by far the most immersive game I've found), [Romans from Mars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Sidekick.Romans360Cardboard&hl=en), [Lamper VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ArchiactInteractive.LamperVR) (it's just fun), [Trooper 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cmdr2.trooper2c), [Proton Pulse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZeroTransform.ProtonPulse), [Snow Strike](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.dpid.snowstrike.free.cardboard&hl=en), [Battle360VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddknot.battle360vr), [Deep Space Rumble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamearx.spacerumble), [SpaceTerror](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kos.is.working&hl=en), [Zombie Shooter VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fibrum.zombievr&hl=en), and [Vanguard V](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZeroTransform.VanguardV).    
* [The Mission: Trailer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.mission&hl=en) starts to show what entire TV shows and movies will be like with this.  
* You can go [climbing with North Face](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.tnf), [look around North Korea](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.northkorea), [testdrive a Volvo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volvo.volvoreality), watch [Paul McCartney](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.mccartney) or [Jack White](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.jackwhite) perform in concert or [fly around the Space Needle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wemersive.spaceneedle). 
* [VR Noir](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.startvr.vrnoircb&hl=en) is a great example of a fun, interactive story.  It's definitely worth trying.  
* There's some really impressive scary experiences.  [Chair in a Room](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RyanBousfield.AChairInARoom&hl=en) is my favorite by far.  I don't like horror very much but it's worth experiencing how VR changes that experience.  Other frightening apps that are worth trying at least once:  [Dark Walls](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nuworks.DarkWalls&hl=en), [VR Silent House](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supermonkeyfun.vrsilenthome), [Sisters](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.otherworld.Sisters), and [Insidious VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.focus.insidiousCardboard).  
* There's a bunch of generic VR experiences that let you walk around places, like [Tuscany Dive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FabulousPixel.TuscanyDive&hl=en), [VR Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.vrmob.island), [VR World](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vr.world.cardboard), and [Village for Google Cardboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.androidworks.villagevr.villagevr).
* [Lost in the Kismet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hihill.link&hl=en) is like a short version of Myst.  
* If you're game, try experiencing a roller coaster, such as [Cedar Point VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CedarFair.CedarPointVR).  
* [War of Words](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BDH.WarofWords) is a brief but meaningful experience.  

#### For iPhones
