title: "Google Cardboard Notes"
---

So, I basically recommend that everyone in my life buy a $12-15 Google Cardboard.  Today.  It's an utterly inexpensive, really great way to start experiencing good virtual reality.  Below are some recommendations that I'm putting together.  I'll keep adding to them, but they should be enough to get you started for now.  

### Overview

Here's a [super short explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4bUHZB4__w) of what Cardboard is.  If you want a longer one, there's a [ton of videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+cardboard) on YouTube that'll help explain.   But really, skip those, just buy one, and load up some apps and experience it yourself.  You won't regret it.  

### Will it work on any smartphone?  

Yes.  Cardboard now works on both Android and Apple phones.  It _might_ not work well on much older smartphones though (3-4+ years old.).  


### Which one should I get?  

Like Android phones, there's dozens of choices - most are solid but plenty are cheap knock offs.  Here's my buying advice:
* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Search on Amazon for '[google cardboard v2](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=google+cardboard+v2)'.  
* Filter the results for those that have [4 or more stars](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agoogle+cardboard+v2%2Cp_72%3A2661618011&keywords=google+cardboard+v2&ie=UTF8&qid=1452147319&rnid=2661617011) and pick one that has plenty of reviews.  
* I'm still trying out others but have used [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018G1CJ3U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00) [two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TEDLGFC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s02) and thought both were solid.  
* Don't spend more than $20 for your first Cardboard.  
* Don't worry about headstraps at this stage.  You're just going to hold it up.  
* Google made several important [changes](https://hoonite.com/blog/devices/the-new-generation-of-google-cardboard-v2-has-arrived/) when they rolled out v2 of the Cardboard standard, so you're better off with that.  v1 Cardboards still work fine.  


### Okay, I've got one.  Now what apps should I try?  

There's a ton to try but here's some highlights to get you started. Remember, it's that any app is the best thing since sliced bread, but rather the innovation and newness of the experience.  

#### For Android phones

* Start with the [official Cardboard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo).
* The [NYT VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.im360nytvr), [Vrse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shakingearthdigital.vrsecardboard), and [Jaunt VR]() apps are all must-haves.  They are full of higher-quality videos.  
* Jaunt is making a ton of [good content](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jaunt+Inc) that is [worth experiencing](http://www.jauntvr.com/content/).  
* The [YouTube and [Street View](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street) apps have a lot of amazing cardboard experiences.  
  * For YouTube, open the app, search for '360' and you'll find an account called '#360Video'.  All of those are cardboard-ready.  Once you press play, you'll see a cardboard icon that you'll press.  
  * For Street View, the best way to interact with it by going in through the official Cardboard app first.  
* [Titans of Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drashvr.titansofspacecb) is beautiful.  
* My favorite games so far are [Caaaaardboard]() (by far the most immersive game I've found), [Lamper VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ArchiactInteractive.LamperVR) (it's just fun), [Trooper 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cmdr2.trooper2c), [Proton Pulse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZeroTransform.ProtonPulse), [Snow Strike](), [Battle360VR](), [Deep Space Rumble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamearx.spacerumble), [SpaceTerror](), and [Vanguard V](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZeroTransform.VanguardV).    
* [The Mission: Trailer]() starts to show what entire TV shows and movies will be like with this.  
* You can go [climbing with North Face](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.tnf), [look around North Korea](), [testdrive a Volvo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volvo.volvoreality), watch [Paul McCartney](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.preview.mccartney) or [Jack White]() perform in concert or [fly around the Space Needle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wemersive.spaceneedle). 
* There's some really impressive scary experiences.  [Chair in a Room]() is my favorite by far.  I don't like horror very much but it's worth experiencing how VR changes that experience.  Other frightening apps that are worth trying at least once:  [VR Silent House](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supermonkeyfun.vrsilenthome), [Sisters](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.otherworld.Sisters), and [Insidious VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.focus.insidiousCardboard).  
* There's a bunch of generic VR experiences that let you walk around places, like [Tuscany Dive](), [VR Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.vrmob.island), [VR World](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vr.world.cardboard), and [Village for Google Cardboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.androidworks.villagevr.villagevr).
* [Lost Kismet]() is like a short version of Myst.  
* If you're game, try experiencing a roller coaster, such as [Cedar Point VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CedarFair.CedarPointVR).  
* [War of Words](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BDH.WarofWords) is a brief but meaningful experience.  

#### For iPhones

Android had a head start so they have more apps but there's plenty to see using an iPhone and more arriving daily.  

* Start with the official Cardboard app
* The NYT VR, Vrse, and Jaunt VR apps are all must-haves.  They are full of higher-quality videos.  
* Jaunt is making [a ton of good content that is worth experiencing](http://www.jauntvr.com/content/).  
* The YouTube and Street View apps have a lot of amazing cardboard experiences.  
  * For YouTube, open the app, search for '360' and you'll find an account called '#360Video'.  All of those are cardboard-ready.  Once you press play, you'll see a cardboard icon that you'll press.  
  * For Street View, the best way to interact with it by going in through the official Cardboard app first.  
* Proton Pulse and Vanguard V are worth trying.  There are others but I haven't had a chance to try them yet.  
* Search the app store for 'google cardboard' and [you'll find more](https://fnd.io/#/us/search?mediaType=ios&term=google%20cardboard).
